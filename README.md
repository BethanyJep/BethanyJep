- 💬 Ask me about: - Data Science, Machine Learning and AI 😄.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything about African Literature, Pyschology, AI and well, fiction.
- 🎨I define myself as a **creative**, trying to create with whatever tools I have! Find my recent creations at [@artsy.chu](https://www.instagram.com/artsy.chu/)
