- 🎨I define myself as a **creative**, trying to create with whatever tools I have! Find my recent creations at [@artsy.chu](https://www.instagram.com/artsy.chu/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a house cat, upon leaving the house you'd probably find me hiking or trying to tick something off my bucket list.
- 🎸 *Music is the rhythm of my soul*: I am currently learning how to play the guitar to strum along to my favourite tunes. Here's what am currently listening to:
